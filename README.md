This branch hosts the ASP.NET Core version of the forum software.

## Technologies
The technologies planned for use in this branch include:
  * ASP.NET Core (duh)
  * TypeScript

The server should also provide proper user authentication, as well as an administrative section for managing the forums themselves.
